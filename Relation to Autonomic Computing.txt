Relation to Autonomic Computing

    Cloud computing and autonomous computing are closely linked ideas with numerous commonalities. 
Both technologies aim to automate computing resource management and improve system performance.

    Autonomic computing is a computer paradigm in which systems may manage and optimize themselves. 
It entails the creation of systems that can monitor and respond to changes in the environment without 
the need for human involvement. Autonomic computing is commonly utilized in large-scale systems like 
data centers and cloud environments to increase system efficiency and save operating expenses. 
In contrast, cloud computing is a methodology for giving on-demand access to computer resources over 
the internet. Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS) 
are all services provided by cloud computing companies. Cloud computing allows businesses to scale their 
computer resources up and down as required, paying only for what they use.

    Cloud computing and autonomic computing are related in that cloud computing providers frequently utilize 
autonomic computing approaches to manage their computer resources. Autonomic computing is used by cloud providers 
to monitor and optimize resource use, identify and respond to security issues, and control overall system performance. 
Autonomic computing is an important component of cloud computing because it enables providers to provide their clients 
with dependable, high-performance services.

    Autonomic computing and cloud computing are technologies that work together to automate the administration of 
computing resources. In cloud settings, autonomic computing approaches are frequently utilized to enhance system 
performance and decrease operating expenses.
