Evolution of Cloud Computing 

      The evolution of cloud computing can be traced back to the dawn of computers and is separated into three major phases: the idea phase, 
the pre-phase, and the cloud phase.

1. Idea phase: The concept of cloud computing first appeared in the 1960s with the creation of time-sharing systems that allowed numerous 
users to access a single computer at the same time. During this time, the concept of virtualization, which allowed multiple virtual machines 
to run on a single physical machine, was also developed.

2. Pre-phase: Grid computing arose in the 1990s, allowing resources to be shared across multiple enterprises. This was a forerunner to cloud 
computing since it allowed for the larger-scale sharing of computing resources. During this time, utility computing, which allowed computing 
resources to be provided as a service, also emerged.

3. Cloud phase: With the introduction of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) in the mid-2000s, the cloud era began. Companies like Amazon and 
Google began to offer IaaS, which allowed organizations to rent computing resources from the cloud, such as servers and storage. This was the 
beginning of cloud computing as we currently understand it. The term "Platform as a Service" (PaaS) first appeared in the late 2000s and early 
2010s as a means for companies to create and deploy cloud-based applications. Software as a Service (SaaS), which enables organizations to 
access software applications over the internet, dominates the present cloud phase. With providers offering a wide range of applications, from 
email to corporate resource planning (ERP) systems, SaaS has grown to be the most well-liked cloud computing model.
