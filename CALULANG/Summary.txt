SUMMARY

    As a result of offering an economical and effective means to store, manage, and access data and applications, 
cloud computing has fundamentally changed the way organizations function. Cloud computing has various advantages, 
including scalability, flexibility, accessibility, and lower infrastructure costs. However, cloud computing, 
like any other technology, has its challenges and drawbacks, such as security concerns, vendor lock-in, and reliance 
on internet connectivity. The idea of autonomous computing has developed as a solution to these problems and as a 
means of enhancing cloud computing's capabilities. Self-governing systems that can adjust to user demands and 
changing settings are a key component of autonomous computing. Autonomic computing strives to provide more effective, 
dependable, and self-healing cloud systems by using artificial intelligence and machine learning.

    Given how quickly technology is developing and how much demand there is for digital transformation, the future 
of cloud computing seems bright. Businesses are increasingly implementing multi-cloud and hybrid cloud strategies 
to benefit from the advantages of various cloud providers and architectures. In the upcoming years, it is anticipated 
that the fusion of cloud computing with cutting-edge technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), edge computing, 
and blockchain will lead to fresh uses and applications. However, as cloud computing spreads, it is critical for businesses 
to address the difficulties and dangers posed by the technology, including data privacy, compliance, and vendor lock-in. 
Businesses must carefully examine their cloud strategy, provider, and security measures in order to fully benefit from 
cloud computing. They must also make sure they have the knowledge and resources required to maintain their cloud environment.

    In conclusion, cloud computing has revolutionized company operations and evolved into a crucial facilitator of digital 
transformation. The capabilities of cloud computing are growing as autonomic computing takes off, resulting in cloud systems 
that are more effective and self-managing. While cloud computing has a promising future, businesses must be on guard and adopt 
a strategic approach to its adoption and management if they are to fully capitalize on its advantages.
